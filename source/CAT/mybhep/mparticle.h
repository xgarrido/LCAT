    represents a "mirror particle", that is a particle and the
    quantities that describe it mirror properties. This class is used to
    describe matching between TRUTH and DIGI particles.
    Tipically, one matches TRUTH and DIGI particles counting the number
    of common "hits" per view, thus those quantities are explicitely
    represented in the class. Also one describes explicitely a
    generalized matching quantity, which can be used to describe the
    quality of the TRUTH-DIGI match. Eventually one may want to use other
    quantities, which are described via a store.
