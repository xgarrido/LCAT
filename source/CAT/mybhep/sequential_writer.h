  Provides common functionality for sequential writers
  A sequential reader can be visualized as a writer accessing
  a tape. Its default action is to write the next event to the tape.

  Derived class need to implement the protected interface,
  which specifies low level actions such as open_file,
  close_file, etc.

  The API consists of  functions obtained from the protected interface


  open(fileName) : open files and init counters
  close():  close file, clears memory, reset counters
  reopen(fileName) : closes previous file and opens again

  write(event,ievent): writes event "ievent" to file
