  Provides common functionality for random writers
  A random reader can be visualized as a writer accessing
  a disk. Its default action is to write an event labeled with a key
  to a random place in the disk. The event is later recovered by the
  same key.

  Derived class need to implement the protected interface,
  which specifies low level actions such as open_file,
  close_file, etc.

  The API consists of virtual functions obtained from the protected interface


  open(fileName) : open files and init counters
  close():  close file, clears memory, reset counters
  reopen(fileName) : closes previous file and opens again

  write(event,key): writes event labeled with key "key" to file
